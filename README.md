# Redux Preboiled ðŸ¥˜ 

Redux Preboiled is a collection of boilerplate-reducing functions for
[Redux][redux] applications. It is built with the following goals in
mind:

- **_Ã€ la carte_ design.** Preboiled's helpers are designed to be largely
  independent from each other, which allows you to pick and choose
  the ones you need without being burdened by the rest.

- **Minimal magic.** Preboiled should reduce the code needed for common
  Redux patterns, but not at the expense of readability. Clever
  metaprogramming and other magic shortcuts are avoided in favor of
  straight-forward understandability.

- **Typing friendliness.** Preboiled is written in [TypeScript][ts].
  It maximizes the benefits of typing by avoiding patterns that are
  hard to type or sacrifice type information (such as metaprogramming
  magic), and minimizes typing effort by allowing for type inference
  wherever possible.

## A First Taste

The following example shows off a bunch of the helpers offered by Preboiled.

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import {
  chainReducers,
  createAction,
  onAction,
  withInitialState
} from 'redux-preboiled'

// `createAction` lets you define an action with minimal ceremony.
// It generates an action creator for a given action type and adds
// a `type` property to it. The latter removes the need to define a
// separate action type constant.
const increment = createAction('increment')

increment()
// => { type: 'increment' }

increment.type
// => 'increment'

// If you call `createAction(...).withPayload()`, the action creator
// takes a value which is attached to the action as `payload`. In
// TypeScript, you can specify the payload type using a type
// parameter, e.g. `withPayload<number>()`.
const multiply = createAction('multiply').withPayload()

multiply(2)
// => { type: 'multiply', payload: 2 }

// Redux Preboiled comes with several helpers for composing reducers.
// Below we use the following ones:
//
// - `onAction`, which creates a sub-reducer for a specific action
//   type. You can directly pass a `createAction` action creator to
//   in place of an action type value. (In TypeScript, this allows 
//   the compiler to infer the type of the `action` parameter 
//   automatically.)
//
//  - `withInitialState`, which can be used to provide an initial 
//    state for sub-reducers that have none (like the ones returned 
//    by `onAction`).
//
//  - `chainReducers`, which composes a sequence of reducers into a
//    "call chain" where each sub-reducer's result is forwarded to 
//    the next sub-reducer in the chain.
//
// Together, these helpers can replace the `switch (action.type)`
// pattern that's commonly used in Redux apps.
const counterReducer = chainReducers(
  withInitialState(0),
  onAction(increment, state => state + 1),
  onAction(multiply, (state, action) => state * action.payload)
)

counterReducer(undefined, { type: '' })
// => 0

counterReducer(0, increment())
// => 1

counterReducer(2, multiply(4))
// => 8

// Redux Preboiled is just a utility library, so there is no special 
// setup to do or middleware to install. Just do everything else as
// usual.

const store = createStore(counterReducer)

store.dispatch(increment())
store.dispatch(increment())
store.dispatch(multiply(2))

store.getState()
// => 4
```
